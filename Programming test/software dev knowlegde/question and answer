1. why is writing software difficult? what makes maintaining software hard?

answer : yes, writing software is difficult, it because the tecnology is improve quickly,
the languages and librabry is rapidly changed, and it is hard to co op wih that,
because developer need to always improve their skills, and renewing their knowledge,

and maintaining software means you need to changed the old code, to the newest version if it, it also sometimes bring errors and bugs because the new version sometimes dont match with the newest version, and you need to configure the way to sync it.
