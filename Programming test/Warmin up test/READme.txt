hi, i am sorry i will submit the warming up test code of the programmer quiz this way


you can just copy the function that i wrote and test it in the hackerrank,
I know it is like that i am putting more work to you, but actually it is my first time using hackerrank,
and i dont really now how to download the code that we've done for the challenge.
